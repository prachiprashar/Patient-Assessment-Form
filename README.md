A modern, responsive, and comprehensive web application for managing patient assessments. Built with a robust React frontend, this project features a dual-form system for both creating new and updating existing patient records, all within a professional and intuitive user interface powered by Ant Design.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Dual Form System:** Includes two separate, dedicated pages:
    -   **Submit Form:** For creating a brand new patient assessment from scratch.
    -   **Update Form:** Simulates fetching existing patient data and pre-populating the form for easy updates.
-   **Complex Form Fields:** Utilizes advanced Ant Design components like multi-select dropdowns, date pickers, and sliders for capturing detailed clinical data.
-   **Professional UI/UX:** Built with a clean layout, a consistent design language, and a sticky header for a polished, enterprise-grade user experience.
-   **Fully Responsive Design:** The layout is mobile-first, ensuring a seamless experience on any device, from large desktops to small smartphones.
-   **Clear Submission Feedback:** Provides instant user feedback with success messages upon form submission, confirming that the data has been processed.

## üìÇ Data Handling & Submission

This project is a **frontend-only application** designed to demonstrate UI/UX and client-side logic.

### 1. How Data is Handled

Upon clicking the "Submit" or "Update" button, the application performs the following actions:
1.  Validates all form fields to ensure the data is complete.
2.  Collects all the data into a single JavaScript object.
3.  **Logs this object to the browser's developer console.**

### 2. Viewing the Output

To see the captured data:
1.  Run the project locally (see instructions below).
2.  Open your browser's Developer Tools (usually by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
3.  Click on the **"Console"** tab.
4.  Fill out and submit either form.
5.  The complete form data object will appear in the console.

> **Note on Production Use:** This console-logging approach is for demonstration purposes only. A production-ready application would send this data via a secure API request to a backend server for storage in a database.
